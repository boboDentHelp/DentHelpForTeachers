| **Let's Encrypt + cert-manager** | cert-manager docs, LetEncrypt guides | @deployment/kubernetes/https-setup/ | ~8 hours |
| **GDPR Compliance** | GDPR Regulation (EU) 2016/679, OWASP docs | @GDPR-COMPLIANCE-POLICY.md (44KB) | ~20 hours |
| **Python FastAPI** | FastAPI docs | CY2 backend (100% by me) | ~15 hours |
| **Next.js** | Next.js docs | CY2 frontend (100% by me) | ~15 hours |
| **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** | OpenAI docs, LangChain docs | CY2 RAG system | ~25 hours |

**Total Self-Directed Learning:** ~263 hours of independent study

**Learning Approach:**
1. **Official documentation first** (always start with source)
2. **Hands-on experimentation** (build, break, debug, fix)
3. **Systematic debugging** (when stuck, research → test → validate)
4. **No shortcuts** (no copy-paste from ChatGPT, understand every line)

**Evidence:**
- @DOT-FRAMEWORK-RESEARCH.md (documents research process for major decisions)
- GitHub commit history (shows iterative learning through trial and error)
- @WEEKLY_REFLECTIONS.md (documents what I learned each week)

---

### 3.2 Proactive Problem Solving

#### Example 1: API Gateway Performance Optimization

**Problem Identified:** API Gateway startup time 200-500 seconds (unacceptable)

**Self-Directed Action:**
1. **Research (2 days):** Studied HikariCP documentation, connection pooling best practices
2. **Root cause analysis:** Found `maximum-pool-size` too high for low-traffic dev environment
3. **Solution:** Applied formula `connections = (core_count * 2) + spindle_count`
4. **Validation:** Startup reduced to 10-20 seconds (20x improvement)

**Outcome:** Professional-level debugging, didn't give up after 2 days

**Evidence:** @database-optimization/README.md, @WEEKLY_REFLECTIONS.md (Week 9-10), FeedPulse Week 10

---

#### Example 2: Kubernetes Networking Issues

**Problem Identified:** Services couldn't communicate in Kubernetes (LoadBalancer IP not assigned)

**Self-Directed Action:**
1. **Debugging:** Checked GKE quotas, found limit exceeded
2. **Solution:** Requested quota increase via Google Cloud Console
3. **Validation:** LoadBalancer assigned, services accessible

**Evidence:** @CLOUD-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md, @LogsCLOUD (deployment logs showing fix)

---

#### Example 3: HTTPS Certificate Generation Failure

**Problem Identified:** cert-manager couldn't generate Let's Encrypt certificate (DNS not configured)

**Self-Directed Action:**
1. **Research:** Studied cert-manager docs, Let's Encrypt requirements
2. **Root cause:** Using nip.io (IP-based DNS) instead of real domain
3. **Solution:** Used HTTP with nip.io for demonstration (HTTPS requires domain purchase)
4. **Documentation:** Documented limitation and workaround

**Evidence:** @deployment/kubernetes/https-setup/HTTPS-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md, @HTTPS-SECURITY-IMPLEMENTATION.md

---

#### Example 4: Docker Networking Between Services

**Problem Identified:** Services couldn't find each other in Docker network

**Self-Directed Action:**
1. **Research:** Studied Docker networking, service discovery patterns
2. **Solution:** Implemented Eureka Server for service discovery, configured Docker network correctly
3. **Validation:** All 9 services communicating successfully

**Evidence:** @docker-compose.yml (Docker network config), microservices/eureka-server/

---

#### Example 5: CI/CD Budget Optimization

**Problem Identified:** GitHub Actions free tier limited to 2000 min/month (at risk of exceeding)

**Self-Directed Action:**
1. **Analysis:** Tracked CI/CD usage, identified waste (running security scans on every feature branch)
2. **Optimization:**
   - Change detection (only build changed services)
   - Conditional jobs (security scans only on main/develop)
   - JAR artifact reuse (avoid rebuilding in Docker step)
3. **Outcome:** Reduced from ~2500 min/month to ~1800 min/month (within budget)

**Evidence:** @.github/workflows/ci.yml (498 lines with optimizations documented)

---

### 3.3 Initiative in Project Management

**Self-Directed Actions:**

1. **Task Breakdown:** Decomposed large features into manageable tasks
   - Example: "Deploy to cloud" → (1) Setup GKE cluster, (2) Create K8s manifests, (3) Configure HTTPS, (4) Load test

2. **Time Management:** Created sprint-based timeline (aligned with FeedPulse checkpoints)
   - Week 1-2: Research & Planning
   - Week 3-4: Requirements & Architecture
   - Week 5-8: Implementation (9 microservices)
   - Week 9-10: Testing & Optimization
   - Week 11-12: Security Documentation
   - Week 13-14: Cloud Deployment

3. **Documentation:** Maintained comprehensive documentation throughout (not at end)
   - Created 30+ documents (500+ KB)

4. **Risk Management:** Identified and mitigated risks early
   - Risk: Behind schedule (Week 4) → Mitigation: Focus mode
   - Risk: Scam internship → Mitigation: Didn't sign contract, left immediately
   - Risk: CY2 team not contributing → Mitigation: Escalated professionally

**Evidence:** @WEEKLY_REFLECTIONS.md (shows sprint planning), @PERSONAL_LEARNING_GOALS.md (timeline)
