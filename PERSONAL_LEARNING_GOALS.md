- **Course Correction:** Entered "focus mode," accelerated work, completed requirements + architecture in 1 week
- **Outcome:** Caught up by Week 5

**Week 7: Internship Scam**
- **Original Plan:** Work 20h/week internship + studies
- **Reality:** Company demanded 40h/week (didn't sign contract, left)
- **Course Correction:** Quit scam internship, continued job search, focused on semester projects
- **Outcome:** More time for projects, secured better internship (ThermoFisher)

**Week 8: CY2 Team Challenges**
- **Original Plan:** Share work 20% per team member (5 people)
- **Reality:** Team members didn't contribute, blamed me for "working too much"
- **Course Correction:** Talked with Sebastian and Robbert, escalated professionally, did 100% BE/FE myself to save project
- **Outcome:** Delivered RAG prototype, 3 out of 4 teammates now improving

**Week 10: API Gateway Performance Issue**
- **Original Plan:** API Gateway should start in <30s
- **Reality:** 200-500 second startup time
- **Course Correction:** Researched HikariCP, optimized connection pooling
- **Outcome:** Reduced startup to 10-20 seconds (20x improvement)

**Week 12: Too Many Internship Applications**
- **Original Plan:** Apply to 50-100 companies
- **Reality:** Applied to 350+ (August-November), getting overwhelming responses
